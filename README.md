# logMMSE
A minimum-mean-square-error noise reduction algorithm implementation with Python

I was finding out a implementation written by Octave, then I convert it to Python,thank you !
However I cant find that right now, give me sometime and I will paste the link when I find it again.


#### *e.g.*
```shell
$ python
```
```python
>>> logMMSE('your_input_file.wav', 'your_output_file.wav')
```
